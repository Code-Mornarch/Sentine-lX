# Sentinel-X

## Overview
SentinelX is a theoretical defensive Python module designed for proactive defense against forensic analysis and counter-hacking attempts. Inspired by the "God's Eye" system from *Fast and Furious*, it serves as an anti-Ramsey shield or provides advanced self-protection in a general context. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under strictly controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **Real-Time Syscall Cloaking**: Hides system calls to evade forensic detection.  
- **ML Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify and respond to suspicious activity.  
- **Self-Healing Code**: Adapts and repairs itself under attack to maintain functionality.  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Acts as a shield against counter-hacking (e.g., Ramsey’s efforts).  
- **General Context**: Provides advanced self-protection for research into defensive techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- Frida-compatible system (e.g., rooted Android, jailbroken iOS, or desktop OS with admin rights)  

## Dependencies
| Library         | Purpose                     | Installation              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `frida`         | Runtime syscall hooking     | `pip install frida`       |
| `xgboost`       | ML anomaly detection        | `pip install xgboost`     |

Built-in import used: `random`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Sentinel-X.git
   cd Sentinel-X
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Frida:
   - Install Frida server on the target system (platform-specific).  
   - Ensure USB debugging or local process access is enabled.

## Usage
SentinelX is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
import frida
import xgboost as xgb
import random

# Attach to target process
device = frida.get_usb_device()
pid = device.spawn(["target_app"])
session = device.attach(pid)

# Load ML anomaly model
model = xgb.Booster()
model.load_model("anomaly_detector.model")

def cloak_syscalls(script):
    # Simulate syscall cloaking
    script.post({"type": "cloak", "call": "sys_open"})
    print("Syscall cloaked")

def sentinel_x():
    # Inject Frida script for runtime hooks
    script_source = """
    Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName(null, "open"), {
        onEnter: function(args) {
            send({type: "syscall", name: "open"});
        }
    });
    """
    script = session.create_script(script_source)
    script.on("message", lambda msg, data: cloak_syscalls(script))
    script.load()

    # Simulate ML anomaly detection
    features = [random.random() for _ in range(5)]  # Placeholder data
    dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix([features])
    anomaly_score = model.predict(dmatrix)
    if anomaly_score > 0.8:
        print("Anomaly detected, initiating self-healing...")
        # Simulate polymorphism
        random.seed()
        print(f"Code morphed with seed: {random.randint(1, 1000)}")

    return "SentinelX active"

# Example usage
sentinel_x()
device.resume(pid)
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Attach to a target process via Frida.  
  3. Run to simulate proactive defense.

## Technical Details
- **Syscall Cloaking**: `frida` hooks runtime functions to mask system calls.  
- **Anomaly Detection**: `xgboost` identifies threats via a pre-trained model (not included).  
- **Self-Healing**: Uses `random` for polymorphic code changes (simplified; real polymorphism needs deeper logic).  

## Limitations
- Requires a pre-trained XGBoost model (not provided).  
- Frida setup is complex and platform-specific; root/admin access is needed.  
- Self-healing is a placeholder—real implementation requires code rewriting or sandboxing.  
- Effectiveness depends on target system and EDR sophistication.
